# PENDRELL 0.4

Pendrell is a fork of Twenty Twelve (formerly a child theme of the same) designed to allow two types of content to co-exist in harmony:

* Blog entries set with beautiful, legible type
* Portfolio items featuring big, bold full-width images

Many WordPress themes provide for one or the other but few handle both types of content with elegance, flexibility, and simplicity.

This theme is suitable for small-scale deployments; it has not been (and likely won't be) optimized for high traffic sites.

You can Pendrell in action on my blog: http://synapticism.com

## INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION

Drop the 'pendrell/pendrell' directory into /wp-content/themes/ and activate it via the WordPress admin interface.

This theme has no options page; you will have to get your feet wet and modify the `functions-config-sample.php` file, renaming it to `functions-config.php`, if you wish to change any of the defaults. Most of these should be self-explanatory; read the comments for more direction.

The following plugins are not quite dependencies but you will probably want to install them to get the most out of Pendrell:

* Crowd Favorite's WP-Post-Formats plugin: https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-post-formats OR...
* My fork of the same: https://github.com/synapticism/wp-post-formats
* Regenerate Thumbnails: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/

## DEVELOPMENT

Two commands to get started hacking Pendrell:

`npm install`
`gem install sass`

## USING THE PORTFOLIO FEATURES

Portfolio items in Pendrell are not custom post types or anything fancy like that; simply make a standard entry under the "Portfolio" category and format your portfolio items however you like. Advanced users can customize what category or categories are treated as portfolio items; just edit `functions-config.php` and modify the `$pendrell_portfolio_cats` variable to include the slugs of any categories you wish to use this feature with. Personally, I have a "Portfolio" parent category with two children, "Design" and "Photography"; all of these plus the "Creative" category are included as defaults in Pendrell.

I happen to like using a mixture of `full-width`, `half-width`, and `third-width` image sizes and regularly feature several different images with each portfolio entry (e.g. a series of photographs, alternate cuts from the same design project, etc.). Layout is a snap: use the media uploader and insert images as "Full Width" (960px wide), "Half Width" (465px wide), or "Third Width" (300px wide). All three sizes come in two versions, either hard cropped or not. Generally speaking, you will want to double or triple up half- and third-width images and apply the `alignleft` style to all but the last in a couplet or triplet, which should be styled with `alignnone`. Managing this is a breeze in the media uploader. The idea here is to let full-width images sprawl and contain half- and third-width images within set boundaries for a nicer layout. If the images you are posting are approximately square you may wish to use the hard cropped versions, otherwise try to ensure that the heights of the images you are laying side by side are approximately the same.

I recommend linking to attachment pages when posting images to your portfolio. The attachment pages in Pendrell are functional, offering EXIF data where available, a link to full-size source material, and thumbnail-based image navigation at the bottom.

Portfolio items are not segregated from other content; your creative projects will appear alongside the rest of your blog entries and still look sharp with a sidebar and widgets. I highly recommend making judicious use of the `<--more-->` tag when posting portfolio items with many images (unless, of course, you'd like to have image-heavy posts co-exist with your regular blog entries).

## FEATURES

### GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS

* Custom site header on top of navigation instead of below
* Entry content type set at 16px for easier reading
* Standardized entry meta data display across post formats
* Comment and edit post actions are now clickable buttons
* Comment button is now below content and invisible on single posts
* Improved post format styling and support
* More descriptive archive headers for different content types
* Removed page margin at top and bottom to make more efficient use of vertical space
* Custom fonts

### PORTFOLIO ITEMS & IMAGES

* Redesigned for full-width multimedia portfolios and image galleries with big, bold images
* Portfolio items are standard posts formatted any way you like and assigned to a portfolio category e.g. "Portfolio"
* This allows portfolio items to flow alongside other content on your blog
* Use the more tag `<!--more-->` after the first or second image in a portfolio item to keep things tidy
* Use half-width images side by side with `alignleft` as needed; these are also responsive
* Portfolio category archives are responsive, shifting between 3, 2, or 1 column display using media queries
* Portfolio item thumbnails default to the first attached image; if you wish to use another just set the featured image
* Thumbnail-based navigation on image attachments
* EXIF data and other information for image attachments
* Full-width images are dynamically displayed on pages using the full-width template
* Get ride of shadows on images using the `no-shadow` class

### HACKS, TWEAKS, & SNIPPETS

* Better, more informative and SEO-friendly page titles
* Human-readable dates on recent entries (e.g. posted 21 hours ago)
* Thumbnail fallback: if a featured image isn't set the appropriately-sized thumbnail of the first image will be displayed
* Clean search rewrites (e.g. website.com/search/query/ instead of website.com?s=query)
* Singleton search results redirect to matching post in one step
* jQuery-based search query markup; surrounds search terms with `<mark>`
* jQuery-based HTML5 pullquotes; `<span class="pullquote">Text</span>` will be transformed into `<aside class="pulledquote">Text</aside>` and prepended
* Context-dependent posts per page (12 items per screen on portfolios, 25 on search, user default elsewhere)
* Reset admin-side HTML editor to a nicer font stack
